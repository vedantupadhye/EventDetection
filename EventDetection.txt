 Standard Pipeline (Used in Industrial AI/ML Systems)
Step 1: Object Detection
Use a model like YOLOv8, EfficientDet, or SSD to detect key objects (person, tool, PPE, etc.)

Identify what’s in the frame

Example: Is there a bottle, welding torch, helmet, glasses, etc.?

Step 2: Pose Estimation (Optional but Powerful)
Use MediaPipe, OpenPose, or HRNet

Helps identify key body joints (e.g., hands, eyes, torso, head)

Useful to know where the object is in relation to the person (e.g., hand near mouth = drinking)

Step 3: Temporal Action Detection
Use short video clips (10–30 frames)

Models: I3D, SlowFast, TSM, or custom 3D CNNs

Focused on actions like “welding”, “bending”, “lifting”, “running”, etc.

Step 4: Decision Logic (Business Rule Engine / Post-processing)
Combine signals from above steps:

"If person is present" + "glasses not detected" + "torch detected near hands" → glasses not worn while welding

May use:

Simple rules

Lightweight ML classifiers

Or symbolic logic (depending on the environment)
